Objectives

Bioinformaticians
- I want to be free to do what I want
- I want to use the software I want
- I want to spend more time developing my pipelines rather than running them for others
- I don't have time to spend on an enduser graphical interface

Geneticists
- I don't want to see any command line
- I just want to click on a button to get my results
- I'm interruptible, I do many things at the same time
- I don't want to be stuck while waiting for my results
- I need a clear report for accreditation
